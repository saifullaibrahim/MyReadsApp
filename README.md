# MyReadsApp
MyReads is a Book Shelf App for Readers to keep track of their reads and search books

MyReads Project is a part of the React Udacity ND.

## Installation and Setup
1. Download or Clone the MyReads App
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`

## Starting the Project
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run the command `npm start`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser to access the landing page


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
